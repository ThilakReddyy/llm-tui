This means that the program will print each number from 1 to 10 on a new line.\n* Inside the loop, we use `std::cout` to output the current value of `n`, followed by a space and then incrementing `n` by 1 using `++`.\n* After the while loop finishes, we return an exit code of 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print:\n```\n1 \n2 3 \n4 5 6 \n7 8 9 10\n```\nNote: In C++, `std::cout` is used for outputting text to the screen. If you want to use a different terminal or console, you may need to modify this code accordingly."
